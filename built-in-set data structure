1)What is set?
ans - A set is a collection of items where each item is uniqueâ€”no duplicates are allowed. 
It's like a bag of things where you don't care about the order, and you only want each item to appear once.

2)Features of set
ans - unordered,mutable and no-duplicate

3)set comprensions
ans - {expression for item in iterable if condition}
ex- 
squares = {x**2 for x in range(1, 6)}
print(squares)  # Output: {1, 4, 9, 16, 25}

4)set code -
ans -
# here we are going to discuss about set methods
bowlers={"bumra","archer","starc","amir","rabada","rashid"}

#mutable onordered dont allow duplicates

# 1 add does not return anything
bowlers.add("s narine")
print(bowlers)

#2 clear() -not retuns anything
#bowlers.clear()

#3 copy() - copy the values from one object to other
#bowlers.copy()

#4 diffrence()
dif_bowlers={"r jadeja","bumra","p cummins","m fizz"}
k=bowlers.difference(dif_bowlers)
print(k)

#5 intersection()-returns the common element btw to sets
print(bowlers.intersection(dif_bowlers))

#6 discard and remove both are same but discard does not raise any error if the value not found in set
bowlers.discard("amir")
print(bowlers)

#7 
bowlers.difference_update(dif_bowlers)
print(bowlers)

#8 pop() - returns the value which has been removed from set
print(bowlers.pop())

#9 disjoint() - retuns a boolean like true if the both sets contain 0 commooon value
print(bowlers.isdisjoint(dif_bowlers))

#10 issuperset() - returns true if all the elements present in set
print(bowlers.issuperset(dif_bowlers))

#11 issubset() - returns true if the set is subset of other
print(bowlers.issubset(dif_bowlers))

#12 union - returns new set of combining in two or more sets into one
print(bowlers.union(dif_bowlers,{1,2,3,3}))
