1)What is regular expression
def -  matching of text with the reqular expression or statement is called regular expression.
ex - 
import re
match=re.search(r"hello","hello devaraja what are u you doing there.")
print(match)
print(match.start())
print(match.end())

2)some of the metaclasses are been used to find out pattern below they are you can see.
i) ^ -  it represents the starting index of the matched pattern.
ii)$ - it represents the ending charcterof the matched pattern.
iii)[] - it represents the set of charchter. 
iv)? - zero or one occurence of charcter.
v)* - one or more occurence of charcter(including zero)
vi)+ - Matches zero or one occurrence
vii)\ - Used to drop the special meaning of character following it
viii). - Matches any character except newline.
ix){} - Indicate the number of occurrences of a preceding RegEx to match.
x)() - Encloses a group of regular expression.

3)Why regular expression.
def - 
1)datamining - to search the required data immediatly in a file or in a group of data.
2)data validation - data validation can be done using the match and regular expression.

4)Letâ€™s understand some of the basic regular expressions. They are as follows:

Character Classes
Rangers
Negation
Shortcuts
Beginning and End of String
Any Character

ex-code
i)character class
import re
print(re.search(r"ab[c]","can u see me"))
#output - it will print out the range of indexes and and the matching pattern

ii)range class
import re
print(re.search(r"[a-z A-Z]","case"))

iii)multiple class
ex - code

import re

print(re.search(r"ca*","this case is "))

iv)addition class 
import re
print(re.search(r"abc+,"learn abcd"))

v)negation character.
ex - code
negatining the character.
import re 
print(re.search(r'G[^e]', 'Geeks Gme')) 
# here in this code u can mathc the charcter G after any other char is okay except e so in the output u can ecpect the "Gm".
