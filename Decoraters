1)what is decoraters?
ans - By using the decorater you can change the behaviour of the function or class.
so below i will demonstrate it with the ex
ex -  code
so here i have created the div function where a is less than b so what users ask me to do is the nominater should always be greater than
the denometer however i pass the parameter it should be negligible.so you have defined the function div and u should not touch div function again.
The task is how do you change the function without entering to this function so here decorater comes into the picture.
def div(a,b):
  print(a/b)

def smartdiv(func):
    def inner(a,b):
        if a<b:
            a,b=b,a
            return func(a,b)
    return inner
div=smartdiv(div)
div(2,4)

2)before know the decorater need tp know some of the thing is that first class object.
it has some features.
i)functioin is an instance of a object.
ii)function can be stored in a variable.
iii)function can return another function.
iv)function call another function.

3)examples for creating decoraters in python
#decoraters in python

def order_eat(func):
    def order():
        print("I will order some food today")
        func()
        print("after eating i will sleep")
    return order
@order_eat
def eat():
    print("I will eat some rice")
# e=order_eat(eat)
@order_eat
def run():
    print("i will run and take the order")
eat()
run()
