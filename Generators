1)what is generators?
def -  Generators are used to acces the things one at a time inside the funciton acts as a iterator.
ex - I can demonstrate the generator example below.
#generators
def topten():
    num=1
    while num<10:
        sq=num*num
        yield sq
        num+=1
t=topten()
for i in t:
    print(i)
