1)what is logging
ans -  It is a process used to record the events of some software which is running.

2)Key Points on Python's Logging Module:
The logging module in Python provides a flexible framework for logging messages from your code.
You can define multiple levels of logging (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) to categorize log messages.
You can configure different output destinations, such as the console, files, or even remote servers.
Using logging effectively can make your code much easier to maintain, debug, and optimize.

3)Advantages of logging module
ans - 1)it is used to track the all the events of application so that we can undestand wherever the erro came and what happened exactly while 
building the application nd the recorded logging files can be used while buliding the same apllication again and we can avoid errors.

4)The levels of logging.
i) debug - It is used to get the detailed information by configuration.(numeric value is 10)
ii) info - It is used to check whether the things working as expected.numeric value is 20)
iii) warning - it updates us that something is not working as expected.numeric value is 30)
iv) error - it updates that some error occured.(numeric value is 40)
v) critical - it updates us that some program itself not working properly.(numeric value is 50)

4)example of creating log files.
ex - code
import logging
logging.basicConfig(filename="abc.log",level=logging.DEBUG)
logging.debug("I have all the information")
logging.info("The things are working as expected")
logging.warning("something is not working as expected")
logging.error("some error occured")
logging.critical("program is not running properly")

5)The format of the log files in the console
level of the logging : name :message

6)what is debuging
ans - It is just simple that finding erros and issues in the program and fix those using proper tools of debugging.
