1)What is testing
ans - Testing is a proces used to test the functionality of a software.

2)What is unit testing?
ans - It is a built-in framework used to check the functionality of program in systemetic and standard way.

2)Why do you choose unittesting framework particularly even though we are having several framework?
ans - Because it gives the many tools for testing
ii)no additonal installation of dependencies are needed.
iii)easy to use.

3)some of the assertion method which are been there in unittest framework.
ans - below u can see some of them.
i).assertEqual(a,b) - used to check whether a euals b or not
ii).assertTrue - checks the boolen value whether it is true or not.
iii).assertIsInstance(a,b) - checks whether a is instance of class b.
iv).assertIsUpper(x) - cheks whether x is uper value or not.

4)steps to create test case for some of the program are below.
step 1 - first import the unittest library.
step 2 - create a class and that class shold inerhit the property of class TestClass.
step 3 - mention the methods inside the class that you want to test.

ex -  code
import unittest
def add(a,b):
  return a+b
class TestCase(unittest.TestCase):
  def postive_nums_add(self):
      self.assertEqual(add(1,2),3)
  def negative_nums_add(self):
      self.assertEqual(add(-1,-2),-3)
  def mixed_nums_add(self):
      self.assertEqual(add(-1,2),1)
      self.assertEqual(add(1,-2),-1)
if __name__=="__main__":
  unittest.main()
