1)what is exception handling?
ans - Exception handling in Python is a mechanism that allows a program to deal with unexpected situations or errors (exceptions) that occur during the execution of a program.
It prevents the program from crashing and gives you the opportunity to handle these errors in a controlled way.

2)Syntax error 
ans - Syntax errors in Python occur when the code violates the languageâ€™s grammatical rules. 
These errors are detected by the Python interpreter at the time the code is parsed, before the program starts running. 
Unlike exceptions (which occur during execution), syntax errors prevent the code from being executed at all.

3)Runtime errors
ans - Runtime errors in Python are errors that occur during the execution of a program.
Unlike syntax errors (which prevent a program from starting), runtime errors happen while the program is running. 
These errors cause the program to stop abruptly if not handled, as they occur due to issues like invalid operations, memory issues, or incorrect user input.

4)what is exception?
ans-An exception in Python (and in programming in general) is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts its normal flow.
Exceptions typically occur when the program encounters something unexpected, like trying to divide by zero, accessing a non-existent file, or converting an invalid value.
When an exception is raised,it can either stop the program or be handled gracefully using exception handling techniques.
