1)What is file handling
ans -  just working the operation like read,write and append operation any kind of file is called file handling.
it is bit slower python compared to other programing languges
 advantage of file handling
i)Versatility - it can perofrm many operation on files like read,write and append or create,rename etc.
ii)flexibility - it is flexible like it can work on all kind of file formates like(txt,csv,bin).
iii)freindly - because it provides a easy to use to interface for users.
iv)cross-platform - it can work in any of the os like(windwos,linux,mac).

sytax for file handling
 f=open(filename,mode)
ii)Some of the mode operation that we can perofrm on files are below.
i) r - we can read the file which is already been exist
ii)w - it can overide the the file and if file not exist it will creat it.
iii)a - append the txt and does not overide the information.
iv)r+ - it can do both read and write but does not overide the file.
v)w+ - it can do bothe write and read but it truncate the file to 0 length and overide it.
vi)a+ - it can read a file and does not overide it.

i)Read operation .
ex -1 : 
1)f=open("abc.txt","w")
f.wirte("Hello good morning")
f.write("how are you")
f.close()
c=open("abc.txt","r")
print(c.read())

2)2nd way of doing it is
with open("abc.txt","r") as f:
    print(f.read())

3)3rd way of reading the file
f=open("abc.txt","r")
for word in f:
    print(word)

ii)Write operation
1)f=open("abc.txt","w")
f.write("What u are planing for weekend")

2)with open("abc.txt","w") as f:
            f.write("write anything")

iii)append operation - it can append infromation to exstining tfile and don't overide
1)f=open("abc.txt","a")
      f.append("This is append operation")
