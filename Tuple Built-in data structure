1) what is Tuple
ans - A tuple in Python is an ordered, immutable collection of items. Once created, its elements cannot be modified.

2)Tuple features
ans - ordered,immutable and heterogeneous 

3)Tuple comprenshions
ans - Tuple comprehensions don't exist in Python as a separate feature. 
However, you can achieve something similar using generator expressions inside a tuple constructor.
ex - # Using a generator expression inside tuple() to create a tuple
my_tuple = tuple(x**2 for x in range(5))
print(my_tuple)

4)Tuple practice code
ans -
#tuple methods
dream_team=("kl","warner","virat","chahal","s mavi","m nabi")
# 1 count() -returns the total number of specified elements in the tuple
print(dream_team.count("virat"))

#2 
print(dream_team.index("kl"))
